# Word-Guess-Game

Deployed Link: https://mwclemons.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/

This was a bootcamp assignment where we mimick a hangman type word guess game.  I used an array of objects to define the hints, answers and images for the game. The project shows my understanding of event listeners, functions, jQuery and string manipulation.
